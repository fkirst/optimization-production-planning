    "The first few sentences should give a quick overview of the entire project. Then, elaborate with a description of the problem that will be solved, a brief history (with [citations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation)) of how the problem came about, why it's important/interesting, and any other interesting facts you'd like to talk about. You should address and explain where the problem data is coming from (research? the internet? synthetically generated?) Also give an outline of the rest of the report.\n",

    "Here, you should code up your model in Julia + JuMP and solve it. Your code should be clean, easy to read, well annotated and commented, and it should compile! You are not allowed to use other programming languages or DCP packages such as `convex.jl`. **I will be running your code**. I suggest having multiple code blocks separated by text blocks that explain the various parts of your solution. You may also solve several versions of your problem with different models/assumptions.\n",
