			CS524 Final Project

Production planning is essential for the management of manufacturing to produce
the right number of products to satisfy customer demand over a specific time
horizon and maximize profit. Our final project is aiming to match production
and sourcing decisions to meet market demand subject to production capacity,
workforce availability, and overtime restrictions. The objective of the problem
is to maximize the profit or minimize the total cost.

We will solve this problem using two types of mathematical models:

a. Deterministic Production Planning Model
   In this approach, we will use the best guess of demand 𝑑 for a period of time,
   i.e. assume the demand is given in a time 𝑡, to model and solve the production
   planning problem.

b. Stochastic Production Planning Model
   In this approach, the demand 𝑑 in a period of time is uncertain. However, we
   are given a set of probabilities associated with demand to find a solution
   that is feasible for all or almost all the possible data and optimizes the
   expected performance of the model.
